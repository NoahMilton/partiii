Supplementary information for Part III Project.
This contains most of the computer code used, as well as some supplementary animations and additional figures.

1. example_animations
	Not necessarily the exact simulations carried out for analysis, but one can see the kind of motions invovled and how particles might behave in these tests. Produced using Paraview.

2. figures
	Those included in the report and additional figures that were deemed not necessary (e.g. if they demonstrated no change with variation of a parameter).

3. LIGGGHTS-inputs
	input files used for most simulations, where variable parameters were changed accordingly, and time step, number of run steps and other parameters may have been varied. This folder also contains the command line script files used to execute multiple LIGGGHTS simulations and to print variable data in a useful way.

4. python-analysis
	separated by single-particle and packing experiments, these demonstrate how data was extracted from LIGGGHTS output files manipulated, and plot. These will not run in this location due to file location referencing differences (analysis was completed in a different location).
